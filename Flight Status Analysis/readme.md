# Flight Status and Air Traffic Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airline data to gain insights into flight statuses and air traffic patterns. The dataset contains information from various airlines, and the goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis of flight status, including on-time, delayed, and canceled flights, as well as the average delay time. Additionally, we aim to uncover valuable information about the best times to book flights and peak flight hours.

## Tasks

### 1. Flight Status Analysis
   - Analyze flight statuses (on time, delayed, canceled) on a month-wise and airline-wise basis.
   - Calculate and visualize the average delay time for different durations.

### 2. Air Traffic Analysis
   - Perform air traffic analysis to determine the optimal times for booking flights.
   - Identify peak hours when the maximum number of flights are available.

### 3. Report Publication
   - Publish the analysis report to a web platform for easy access and sharing.

### 4. Dashboard Creation
   - Pin relevant tiles and visualizations to a dynamic dashboard.

### 5. Collaborative Sharing
   - Share the dashboard with colleagues for collaborative decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Dataset:** Contains airline data.
- **Analysis:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Visualization:** Power BI or Tableau.
