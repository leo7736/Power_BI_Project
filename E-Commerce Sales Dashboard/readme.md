<!-- Problem Statement -->
## Problem Statement

A US-based Ecommerce Sales Company has tasked us with creating a Sales Dashboard to provide insights into Year-to-Date (YTD) sales performance. The dashboard aims to visualize key sales metrics and generate insights for various scenarios:

* **KPI Banner:** Display YTD Sales, YTD Profit, YTD Quantity sold, and YTD Profit Margin.
* **Year-on-Year Growth:** Calculate YTD sparklines and Year-on-Year growth for each KPI to understand monthly trends.
* **Customer Category Analysis:** Determine YTD Sales, Previous Year YTD (PYTD) Sales, and YoY Sales growth for different customer categories, with trend icons.
* **State-wise Performance:** Visualize YTD Sales performance for each state.
* **Product Analysis:** Identify the Top 5 and Bottom 5 Products by Sales.
* **Regional Performance:** Analyze YTD Sales by Region to identify the best and worst performing regions.
* **Shipping Type Insights:** Explore YTD Sales by Shipping Type to determine the best shipping type percentage.

<!-- Insights -->
## Insights

Throughout the project, I generated the following sample insights from the Ecommerce Sales Dashboard:

* **Metrics:** Even though YTD sales show a decline of -0.83%, the YTD Profit is up by 4.5%.
* **State-wise Performance:** California and New York consistently maintain the highest YTD sales performance, while Montana and Wyoming have room for improvement.
* **Product Analysis:** The "Electronics" category dominates both the Top 5 and Bottom 5 products by sales. However, there's a notable difference in sales performance within the category itself.
* **Regional Performance:** The Western region shows the highest YTD sales, contributing 42% to the total sales revenue. The Southern region lags behind with only 18% of the total sales.
* **Shipping Type:** Standard shipping is the most preferred choice, accounting for 60% of the YTD sales. Express and Economy shipping methods share the remaining 40%.
