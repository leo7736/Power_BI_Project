## Insights

After analyzing the insurance data, the following insights were uncovered:

1. **High Schoolers Accident Rate:** High schoolers have a significantly higher accident claim rate compared to other age groups. This highlights the need for targeted education and safety measures for young and inexperienced drivers.

2. **Rear Collisions:** A majority of reported collisions were rear collisions. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining safe following distances and being aware of surroundings.

3. **January Accident Rate:** The accident rate is notably higher in January, possibly due to icy road conditions and reduced visibility. Cautious driving during winter months is crucial.

4. **Gender Disparity:** Females submitted a higher number of insurance claims than males. Investigating this disparity could provide insights for tailoring insurance policies and outreach efforts.
